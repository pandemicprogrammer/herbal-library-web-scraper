            "The polysaccharide content of reishi mushroom is responsible for possible anticancer and immunostimulatory effects. Reishi may also provide hepatoprotective action, antiviral activity, and beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and diabetes. Few clinical trials have been conducted.",
            "ThePharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of Chinarecommends 6 to 12 g reishi extract daily. Ganopoly (a Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharide extract) in doses up to 5.4 g daily (equivalent to 81 g of the fruiting body) for 12 weeks has been used in a few clinical trials.",

            "There are few reports of toxicity with the use of reishi mushroom.",
            "The reishi mushroom is a purplish-brown fungus with a long stalk, brown spores, and a fan-shaped cap with a shiny, varnish-coated appearance. Reishi grows on decaying wood or tree stumps1preferring the Japanese plum tree but also found on oak. The mushroom is native to China, Japan, and North America but is cultivated throughout other Asian countries. Cultivation of reishi is a long, complicated process. The reishi grows in 6 colors, each thought to have different characteristics and known as: Aoshiba (blue reishi), Akashiba (red reishi), Kishiba (yellow reishi), Shiroshiba (white reishi), Kuroshiba (black reishi), and Murasakishiba (purple reishi).2,3",
            "Reishi has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 4,000 years for treating fatigue, asthma, cough, and liver ailments, and to promote longevity.2The Chinese namelingzhimeans \"herb of spiritual potency.\"2A Japanese name for the reishi ismannentake, meaning \"10,000-year-old mushroom.\" Reishi's use is documented in the oldest Chinese medical text, which is more than 2,000 years old.4Cultivation of reishi began in the 1980s. A survey conducted in Hong Kong found G. lucidum to be the third most common herbal preparation taken by preoperative surgical patients.5",
            "The reishi mushroom is high in polysaccharide content with at least 36 different compounds identified6including beta-d-glucan and GL-1.2,3,7Triterpene constituents also have been analyzed.8Triterpene antioxidants, including ganoderic acids A, B, C, and D; ganoderol A and B; ganoderol A; lucidenic acid B, and ganodermanontriol have been found in reishi.1,2,6,9,10,11Terpenoids 1, 2, and 3, and terpenes lucidenic acid O and lucidenic lactone are also present.3,6,12A peptidoglycan from reishi contained approximately 7% protein and 76% carbohydrate.13Certain enzymes from reishi have been reported14as well as minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Lanostan, coumarins, ergosterol, and cerevisterol are also components of reishi.2,3,12",
            "Polysaccharides isolated from reishi have been proven effective in vitro against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2.(46) Reishi isolates also have been tested against other viral strains, including influenza A, and demonstrated effectiveness against their replication.(47)",
            "Anticancer effects of reishi have been reported largely from in vivo experiments, and data from clinical trials have been published. It is generally accepted that the anticancer effects are due to immune enhancement(3,15) and may be exhibited from diverse chemical constituents in reishi.(6,16,17) Experiments focused on the stimulatory effects of the higher molecular weight polysaccharides (eg, ganopoly, beta-d-glucan, GL-1) on the immune system(3,7,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29) and the suppressive effect of the triterpenes (eg, ganoderic acid) on the growth and invasive behavior of cancer cells.(15,16,18,30,31,32,33,34) An ethanol soluble compound ganoderol B binds to androgen receptors and inhibits the sterol enzyme 5-alpha-reductase in experiments in rats.(1)",
            "Clinical trials have been conducted in patients with advanced cancer.(15,16,35) Not all published trials are randomized and blinded. Ganopoly in doses up to 5.4 g daily (equivalent to 81 g of the fruiting body) for 12 weeks were used. Increased cellular immunity indices were reported in 80% of cancer patients in one trial.(36) Quality of life improved in 65% of patients in another trial.(16) In a further trial, varying results were obtained. It was proposed that ganopoly could reverse the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.(36,37) A 2011 systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of G. lucidum, regardless of preparation, in Chinese cancer patients. A total of 5 randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria, all of which had unsatisfactory methodological quality. The analysis showed a positive treatment response was more likely to occur in patients who received G. lucidum in combination with chemo-/radiotherapy than with either G. lucidum or chemo-/radiotherapy alone. The data are insufficient to justify use of G. lucidum as a first-line treatment for cancer. Data also suggested improved immune function via increases in CD3, CD4, and CD8.(51)",
            "In a case report of the effect of lingzhi on gastric large B-cell lymphoma, the patient consumed 3 times the recommended dose for 5 days (60 capsules daily). Histological changes were recorded 11 days later, showing only a dense infiltrate of T lymphocytes remaining.(38)",
            "The effect of reishi on the cardiovascular system has been investigated. Decreases in high blood pressure were reported to be attributed to the ganoderic acids.(2) Angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibiting triterpenes from reishi have been described.(3,39)",
            "Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, enhanced antioxidase activity, decreased platelet aggregation(2,3,40) and reduced lipid peroxidation have been demonstrated in animal and in vitro experiments.(2,3,10)",
            "A randomized, double-blind, crossover trial (n = 23) reported no significant changes in body mass index, blood pressure, glycemic indices, antioxidant capacity, lymphocytes, urine catecholamines, cortisol, or cortisone when 1.44 g/day of lingzhi (equivalent to 13.2 g of fresh mushroom) or placebo was administered to patients with borderline elevated blood pressure and/or cholesterol. The only significant change in lipid profile was apo-B, which increased significantly in the placebo group.(52)",
            "A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in China. Ganopoly 5.4 g daily was administered for 8 weeks, resulting in a reduced sense of fatigue and lower Clinical Global Impression severity scores.(31)",
            "In animal experiments, ganopoly affected carbohydrate metabolism and promoted insulin secretion.(3)",
            "A randomized, multi-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled 84 adults with metabolic syndrome and high fasting blood glucose to investigate the safety and efficacy of 3 g/day G. lucidum (with and without Cordyceps sinensis) on hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors. However, because they failed to recruit the sample size needed to assess the 3 groups separately, they combined data for both G. lucidum treatment groups into a single \"intervention group.\u201d Compared to placebo, none of the primary (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose) or secondary outcomes (ie, lipid parameters, blood pressure, anthropomorphic measurements) were significantly affected by the interventions after 16 weeks. All of the participants had type 2 diabetes.(53) In a review, ganopoly 1,800 mg 3 times daily reduced postprandial glucose values in patients with type 2 diabetes in a clinical trial. The glucans ganoderan A and B (glucans) inhibited hypoglycemia.(3)",
            "In in vitro and in vivo animal experiments, hepatoprotection by extracts of ganoderma against induced liver damage has been demonstrated.(3,26,41,42,43)",
            "A review documented that polysaccharide ganopoly therapy for 6 months resulted in normalization of aminotransferase levels in 33% and cleared serum hepatitis B surface antigen in 13% of trial participants compared with control.(3)",
            "Because high-altitude training can cause immunosuppression, the effect of G. lucidum on T-lymphocyte subsets in young male football players (n=40) undergoing simulated high-altitude training (living high-training low; LHTL) was evaluated in a 6-week randomized controlled trial. A 20 g/day dose of G. lucidum significantly increased CD3+ from baseline on day 21 and tended to increase CD4+/CD8+ ratios, but differences were not significant over time for either measurement.(50)",
            "G. lucidum 6 mg once daily for 12 weeks was well tolerated and significantly decreased the International Prostate Symptom Score, compared with placebo, in men older than 49 years with lower urinary tract symptoms. No significant changes were noted in quality of life or for any of the secondary outcome measures (ie, prostate size, residual volume after voiding, peak urinary flow, serum prostate-specific antigen, testosterone levels).(54) The dose was based on a previously conducted dose-ranging study.(55)",
            "The effect of reishi on the immune system has been studied in in vitro experiments. In an experiment using synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, researchers demonstrated an inhibitory effect of a polysaccharide extract on the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts, possibly via the nuclear factor-kappa B transcription pathway.(44)",
            "Traditional practitioners recommend 0.5 to 1 g daily, 2 to 5 g daily for chronic illness, and up to G. lucidum 15 g extract daily for serious illness.5The Chinese pharmacopoeia recommends 6 to 12 g extract daily.5Doses up to Ganopoly 5.4 g daily (equivalent to 81 g of the fruiting body) for 12 weeks have been used in clinical trials.35",

            "In a small, placebo-controlled trial designed to determine adverse reactions related to reishi use, 4 g of extract daily for 10 days taken by healthy adults resulted in no differences between participants receiving reishi and those taking placebo.48No changes in blood CD4, CD8, or CD19 were observed, and insignificant increases in CD56 were noted.48",
            "Ganodermic acid S and adenosine-related compounds found in reishi are thought to cause platelet inhibition, and a protease compound has been demonstrated to competitively inhibit thrombin-fibrinogen binding in in vitro experiments. However, another placebo-controlled trial using 1.5 g of extract daily for 4 weeks did not result in any changes in platelet or hemostatic function.49",
            "Data collected between 2004 and 2013 from 8 US centers in the Drug-induced Liver Injury Network revealed that 15.5% (130) of hepatotoxicity cases were caused by herbals and dietary supplements, whereas 85% (709) of cases were related to prescription medications. Of the 130 cases of liver injury related to supplements, 65% were from non-bodybuilding supplements and occurred most often in Hispanics/Latinos compared with non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. Liver transplant was also more frequent with toxicity from non-bodybuilding supplements (13%) than with conventional medications (3%) (P<0.001). Overall, the proportion of severe liver injury cases was significantly higher for supplements than for conventional medications (P=0.02). Of the 217 supplement products implicated in liver injury, 175 had identifiable ingredients, of which reishi mushroom was among the 32 (18%) single-ingredient products.56The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) clinical practice guideline for drug-induced liver injury (2019) recommends physicians consider herbal and dietary supplements as potential causative agents associated with liver injury (Level 4; Grade C), including reishi mushrooms (G. lucidum).45",

            "Limited evidence from meta-analyses suggests that curcumin, the most commonly studied constituent of turmeric, and/or curcuminoids have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects and may improve biomarkers and symptoms in patients with osteoarthritis, major depression, cardiovascular risk, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Data are equivocal in dysglycemic/diabetic populations, and are insufficient to identify a role for curcumin in patients with chronic pruritic skin lesions, cognitive decline, inflammatory bowel disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, oral mucocutaneous conditions, psoriasis, or uveitis.",
            "Generally, standardized curcuminoid dosages of 200 mg/day to 6 g/day (treatment durations of up to 8 months) have been used in clinical trials evaluating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of curcumin in a variety of conditions. Lipid-based formulations have shown improved bioavailability over micronized and unformulated curcumin preparations, with greater improvements observed in women compared to men.",
            "Use is contraindicated if hypersensitive to any of the components of curcumin. Avoid use during pregnancy and lactation because of emmenagogue and uterine stimulant effects. Turmeric should not be used in patients with gallstones or bile duct or passage obstruction.",

            "The genus Curcuma L. may consist of more than 100 species, with C. longa L. probably being the most well-known. Synonymous with Curcuma domestica Val, turmeric is a perennial plant found throughout Southeast Asia, China, Australia, and the South Pacific. India and Thailand have the highest diversity, with at least 40 species in each country. The plant grows to a height of 0.9 to 1.5 m and produces large, oblong leaves and funnel-shaped, dull yellow flowers. The thick rhizome is yellowish externally and deep orange to reddish brown internally. The lateral rhizomes contain more yellow coloring than the bulb. The dried primary bulb and secondary lateral rhizomes are collected, cleaned, boiled, and dried for use in medicinal and food preparations.Goel 2008,Leong-Skornickov\u00e1 2007,Pari 2008,Strimpakos 2008,USDA 2019",
            "Traditionally, turmeric has been used as a food and cosmetic, and also medicinally for a variety of conditions. Turmeric is a spice with a warm and bitter taste, used primarily as a component of curry powders and some mustards. Its distinctive yellow color has commercial applications as a coloring agent in cheese, butter, and other foods.Goel 2008,Pari 2008,Strimpakos 2008",
            "Turmeric and its natural curcuminoids have been used medicinally for centuries in various parts of the world. In the traditional Ayurvedic medical system, turmeric is a well-recognized treatment for numerous respiratory conditions (eg, asthma, bronchial hyperactivity, allergies), liver disorders, anorexia, rheumatism, diabetic wounds, cough, and sinusitis.Aggarwal 2007,Goel 2008In the Indian subcontinent, turmeric is valued for its wound healing properties. In traditional Chinese medicine, turmeric is used to treat conditions that cause abdominal pain. Due to its anti-inflammatory activity, turmeric was used to treat sprains and swelling in ancient Hindu medicine.Aggarwal 2007,Goel 2008",
            "The rhizome contains up to 7% of an orange-yellow, volatile oil. Tumerone and artumerone together comprise about 60% of the oil, and zingiberene comprises about 25%. Cineole, d-phellandrene, d-sabinene, and borneol are present in low concentrations. The major yellow pigment has been identified as curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a phenolic antioxidant. Antioxidant properties have also been attributed to the proteins turmerin, turmeric antioxidant protein, BGS-Haridrin, and beta-turmerin.de Boer 2014Unlike most natural antioxidants that contain either beta-diketone or polyphenolic functional groups, curcumin possesses both active moieties; its superior antioxidant activity has been attributed to this structural combination. Curcumin modulates the Nrf2-keap1 pathway in the cell and binds to antioxidant-responsive elements in DNA that reduce reactive oxygen species. Other curcuminoids structurally related to curcumin are also found in the extract, including demethoxy-curcumin and bis-demothoxy-curcumin. Additionally, the turmeric rhizome contains protein, fat, minerals, and carbohydrates.Aggarwal 2007,Farooqui 2018,Goel 2008,Joshi 2003,Leong-Skornickov\u00e1 2007,Pari 2008,Phan 2001,Quiles 2002,Strimpakos 2008",
            "Many clinical trials focus on the active principle curcumin rather than on turmeric. Curcumin has limited medicinal use because of its low systemic bioavailability following oral dosing. Curcumin is hydrophobic and cannot be given intravenously (IV); it also disappears rapidly from tissues after intraperitoneal administration. Numerous approaches continue to be investigated to improve curcumin's bioavailability, including concomitant use of black pepper (Piper nigrum) or piperine, an active constituent of black pepper.(Cui 2009,Farooqui 2018,Yu 2012)",
            "Formulations using emulsifiers and a variety of hydrophilic and hydrophobic carriers have demonstrated increased oral absorption and bioavailability compared with unformulated curcumin.(Gopi 2017,J\u00e4ger 2014,Purpura 2018,Schiborr 2014) For example, in healthy volunteers, use of a lipid-based micelle formulation and of micronized powder increased overall relative systemic bioavailability (area under the curve [AUC]) and maximum concentration (Cmax) of curcumin compared with unformulated curcumin powder. In a crossover study, the micelle and micronisate formulations increased bioavailability by 9-fold and Cmaxby 6-fold overall, with higher increases observed in women. Bioavailability increased 277 and 14 times in women (vs 114 and 5 times in men) with micelles and micronisate, respectively, and Cmaxincreased 806 and 11 times in women (vs 251 and 3 times in men), respectively, relative to native, unformulated curcuminoid powder. Only the micelle formulation reduced time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax). No gender differences were observed for any of the individual curcuminoids (curcumin, demethoxy-curcumin, and bis-demothoxy-curcumin) with respect to Cmaxor Tmax. The mean percentages of the oral curcumin dose recovered from 24-hour urine samples were 0.002%, 0.007%, and 0.151% for the native, micronized, and micellar forms, respectively. Excretion of curcuminoids was higher in women than in men.(Schiborr 2014)",
            "In a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative study (N=120), adults with osteoarthritis of the knee experienced reductions in severity of pain and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) functional scale score when administered 500 mg of C. longa rhizome extract twice daily (each 500 mg oral gelatin capsule containing 12.6% w/w polysaccharides). A decrease in use of rescue analgesic (acetaminophen) was also observed with C. longa compared with placebo. Study medication acceptability was highest for the C. longa group, which also exhibited the fewest adverse effects.(Madhu 2013) A systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 randomized clinical trials (N=734) published before December 2014 found an overall moderate to large effect of Zingiberaceae extracts (including turmeric, ginger, and galangal) on chronic pain compared with placebo; however, substantial heterogeneity was found. Two trials used curcumin or curcuminoids (n=90): in one study evaluating patients with osteoarthritis of the knee, 1,500 mg/day of curcuminoids (combined with 15 mg/day of black pepper extract to enhance bioavailability) given for 6 weeks demonstrated significant reductions in pain compared to placebo; and in the other study of patients recovering from surgery, curcumin 2,000 mg/day given for 3 weeks resulted in significantly lower pain compared to the placebo group.(Lakhan 2015) In a 4-week, double-blind, randomized controlled comparator study enrolling 367 adults with primary knee osteoarthritis (mean patient age, 60 years; 90% women), a noninferiority test determined curcumin extract (1,500 mg/day [administered as 500 mg 3 times daily]) was as effective as ibuprofen (1,200 mg/day [administered as 400 mg 3 times daily]) in improving pain and function. Curcumin improved overall osteoarthritis index scores (P=0.01), pain (P=0.018), and function (P=0.01). The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups, but more patients in the ibuprofen group experienced abdominal pain and distension.(Ross 2016)",
            "A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials reported reduced pain scores for curcumin compared with placebo in patients with arthritis (eg, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis). Curcumin dosages were similar across the studies, with about 1 g/day given in the absence of other analgesics and about 500 mg/day given concomitantly with an analgesic agent (ie, ibuprofen, diclofenac, glucosamine). Duration of treatment ranged from 4 weeks to 4 months. Pooled results showed no difference between curcumin and other analgesic medications, suggesting standardized turmeric extracts (typically 1 g/day of curcumin) can reduce arthritis symptoms (mainly pain and inflammation-related symptoms) and result in improvements similar to those with conventional analgesic agents.(Daily 2016)",
            "The updated American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline on the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee (2021) recommends that turmeric may be helpful in reducing pain and improving function for patients with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee (limited).(Brophy 2022)",

            "Older clinical trials have compared curcumin with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone.(Pari 2008) In 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in hemodialysis patients (N=171), turmeric 1,500 mg/day was associated with better improvements from baseline in several anti-inflammatory markers compared with placebo: Mean reductions in pruritus and C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed after 8 weeks of treatment in one study,(Pakfetrat 2014) and reductions in mean interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha, and high-sensitivity CRP were observed in the second study after 12 weeks of intervention.(Samadian 2017)",
            "In a randomized controlled trial of patients who had undergone removal of impacted third molars (N=90), both the active control (mefenamic acid) and curcumin (400 mg 3 times daily for the first 24 hours after anesthesia effect had worn off) were effective in reducing postoperative inflammatory pain. The curcumin group reported significantly higher reductions in pain at each time point (P=0.0001 each).(Maulina 2018) In a split-mouth randomized controlled trial of 40 patients with localized, mild to moderate chronic periodontitis, local delivery of turmeric was not significantly different from chlorhexidine, the \"gold standard\" in periodontics, regarding improvement in inflamed gingival tissues, reductions in probing pocket depth, and gain in attachment.(Singh 2018)",
            "In a meta-analysis of 7 treatments across 6 studies (N=172), a significant reduction in the systemic inflammation biomarker CRP occurred with use of standardized curcuminoid preparations taken for at least 4 weeks. Dosages ranged from 200 mg/day to 6 g/day, and bioavailability varied. Over half of the studies (4 of 6) were of high quality, while the other 2 were of low quality; overall heterogeneity was high.(Sahebkar 2014) In a systematic review and meta-analysis that pooled data from 9 controlled studies (N=609), a non\u2013dose-dependent beneficial effect of curcuminoids on IL-6 concentrations was observed. Dosages of standardized curcuminoids ranged from 200 mg/day to 6 g/day given for 2 weeks to 8 months. Study populations included patients with osteoarthritis, oral lichen planus, obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, sulfur mustard intoxication, and chronic pruritic skin lesions. Overall, curcuminoids significantly reduced plasma IL-6 compared with placebo (weighted mean difference [WMD], \u22120.6 pg/mL;P=0.011), regardless of dose or formulation. An intervention duration of at least 8 weeks provided a significant effect (P=0.001) compared with durations of less than 8 weeks. Meta-regression analysis identified baseline IL-6 concentrations as a significant factor in degree of benefit.(Derosa 2016)",
            "Clinical trials conducted in a variety of patient populations (ie, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, end-stage renal disease, oral submucous fibrosis) have demonstrated significant reductions in several markers of oxidative stress with use of curcumin.(Marx 2017,Panahi 2015,Pipalia 2016,Usharani 2008) In a meta-analysis of published clinical trials investigating the effects of curcumin on biomarkers of oxidative stress, either turmeric powder or curcuminoids was administered for 4 weeks to 4 months; study populations included patients with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, osteoarthritis, end-stage renal disease, and chronic pruritic skin lesions. Pooled results showed significant reductions in serum malondialdehyde (MDA) (7 trials [n=525];P<0.022) and plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) (4 trials [n=336];P<0.0001) with curcumin compared with controls, but not in glutathione peroxidase. Subgroup analysis showed significant reductions in circulating MDA with concentrated turmeric extract and with curcuminoids (especially when combined with piperine), but not with turmeric powder; with respect to doses evaluated, significant differences in MDA were observed between experimental and placebo groups particularly when curcuminoids were administered at dosages of at least 600 mg/day. Neither the duration of treatment nor the underlying disease had an effect on MDA. SOD was not affected by any of the variables.(Qin 2018) In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 89 male Iranian war veterans with chronic pulmonary complications from sulfur mustard poisoning, significantly greater improvements in MDA and reductions in glutathione (P<0.001 for each) were observed with curcuminoids/piperine than with placebo. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment scores (P<0.001) and total as well as subscale respiratory symptom scores were significantly improved in both groups; however, the magnitude of improvement was significantly greater in the curcuminoid group.(Panahi 2016)",
            "In a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled comparative study (N=120), adults with osteoarthritis of the knee experienced reductions in severity of pain and WOMAC functional scale score when administered 500 mg of C. longa rhizome extract twice daily (each 500 mg oral gelatin capsule containing 12.6% w/w polysaccharides). A decrease in use of rescue analgesic (acetaminophen) was also observed with C. longa compared to placebo. The C. longa group also exhibited the fewest adverse effects.(Madhu 2013) In a 4-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled comparator study enrolling 367 adults with primary knee osteoarthritis, a noninferiority test determined curcumin extract (1,500 mg/day [administered as 500 mg 3 times daily]) was as effective as ibuprofen (1,200 mg/day [administered as 400 mg 3 times daily]) in improving pain and function. Curcumin improved overall osteoarthritis index scores (P=0.01), pain (P=0.018), and function (P=0.01).(Ross 2016)",
            "A meta-analysis of data from 2 low-quality trials (N=574) that compared C. longa extract with ibuprofen in patients with osteoarthritis found no significant difference between the treatment groups in pain outcomes (odds ratio [OR]=0.89; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.36), physical function (OR=1.09; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.52), or adverse events (relative risk [RR]=1.28; 95% CI, 0.55 to 2.98).(Del Grossi 2017) A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials reported significantly reduced pain scores for curcumin compared with placebo in patients with arthritis (eg, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis). Curcumin dosages were similar across the studies, with about 1 g/day given in the absence of other analgesics and about 500 mg/day given concomitantly with an analgesic agent (ie, ibuprofen, diclofenac, glucosamine). Duration of treatment ranged from 4 weeks to 4 months. Pooled results showed no significant difference between curcumin and analgesic medications, suggesting standardized turmeric extracts (typically 1 g/day of curcumin) can reduce arthritis symptoms and result in improvements similar to those with conventional analgesic agents. Functional outcomes, including morning stiffness and movements, improved with curcumin, but fundamental improvement in arthritis symptoms were not observed. At dosages up to 1,200 mg/day for up to 4 months, turmeric preparations and curcumin were considered safe.(Daily 2016) Similarly, in a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 dietary supplements used for treating osteoarthritis, short-term (less than 3 months) use of C. longa extract and curcumin was associated with large and clinically important reductions in pain and improvements in physical function. However, evidence was very limited. Of all the supplements tested, only C. longa extract demonstrated statistically significant differences (ie, reductions) in the use of analgesics (risk ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.8).(Liu 2018) Patients with knee osteoarthritis taking curcuminoid or non-curcuminoid turmeric extract experienced significantly less knee pain than placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD] \u22120.82; 95% CI, \u22121.17 to \u22120.47;P=0.00) with similar benefit compared to NSAIDs (SMD \u22120.09; 95% CI, \u22120.3 to +0.12;P=0.2) based on 12 randomized clinical trials (n=1,071) and 5 randomized clinical trials (n=648), respectively. Similar results were observed with turmeric extract on physical function compared to placebo (P=0.00) and NSAIDs (P=0.35). Patients with a lower body mass index (BMI) were more likely to respond. Rates of adverse events with turmeric extracts were similar to placebo and lower than that of NSAIDs (risk difference, \u221212%; 95% CI, \u221224% to 1%;P=0.18).(Wang 2021) Systematic reviews and meta-analyses continue to be published supporting the benefit of C. longa extract over placebo in patients with osteoarthritis regardless of dose or duration.(Dai 2021)",
            "In a randomized, single-blind pilot study, 45 adults with rheumatoid arthritis were randomly assigned to receive curcumin 500 mg, diclofenac 50 mg, or the combination of the 2 agents twice daily for 8 weeks. All 3 groups experienced improvements from baseline in disease activity scores and American College of Rheumatology joint scores. Improvements in these scores were better in the curcumin group than in the diclofenac group.(Chandran 2012) A systematic review of randomized controlled trial data identified 6 studies overall that met inclusion criteria that investigated oral spice supplementation for rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to the previous study, another double-blind one assessed and administered curcumin 250 and 500 mg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks in 36 adults currently not being treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or disease-modifying antirhematic drugs. No conclusion could be drawn due to a lack of between-group statistical comparisons and the low-quality of evidence.(Letarouilly 2020)",

A limited number of patients demonstrated stable radiological conditions for up to 4 months after curcumin treatment.(Garcea 2005) Reduction in the biomarker M1G after curcumin use was attributed to an antioxidant action of curcumin in the tumor. Clinical outcomes were not reported. Investigators concluded that pharmacologically active levels of curcumin could not be achieved in patients with hepatic metastases because of poor oral bioavailability.(Pari 2008)",

Measures of antiatherogenic activity (pulse wave velocity, adiponectin, leptin, insulin resistance, triglycerides, uric acid, and total body fat) were significantly improved at 6 months (P<0.001), as was visceral fat (P<0.05). Most of these parameters were also significantly improved at the 3-month visit. Compliance was comparable between the treatment and placebo groups, with no serious adverse effects reported.(Chuengsamarn 2014) In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolling 100 patients with type 2 diabetes, between-group comparisons showed significant improvement in some, but not all, lipid parameters with administration of curcuminoids.

Differences in attention were also significantly better in the curcumin group compared with placebo at 18 months. No significant change between groups was seen for visual memory assessments. Deposition of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the hypothalamus was significantly improved with curcumin compared with placebo, and correlated significantly with changes in Beck Depression Inventory scores (P=0.02 vs placebo).

After 6 weeks of treatment, curcumin was found to be equivalent to fluoxetine regarding the proportion of responders, based on Hamilton depression scale scores; patients receiving combination therapy with curcumin and fluoxetine showed a better response than those receiving either as monotherapy, but these data were not statistically significant. Fewer patients receiving curcumin achieved remission compared to fluoxetine. Curcumin was well tolerated, with only mild gastritis and nausea reported.(Sanmukhani 2014) In an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (N=56) in subjects with major depressive disorder, both placebo and curcumin 1,000 mg/day provided improvements from baseline to week 4 in self-reported depression and anxiety scores.

            "A meta-analysis of 14 randomized clinical trials (N=1,268) investigated the effects of turmeric on blood lipid metabolism in adults with metabolic diseases that included being overweight, obesity, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Turmeric products (ie, curcumin, curcuminoids with/without piperine, turmeric, nano-curcuminoids) that were administered for at least 4 weeks up to 6 months provided significant improvements in all lipid parameters. Subgroup analyses identified a treatment duration longer than 8 weeks and a curcuminoid dose of more than 300 mg/day to enhance efficacy.(Yuan 2019) A meta-analysis of data from 11 randomized, placebo-controlled trials (N=1,144) found an overall significant decrease in fasting blood glucose (WMD, \u22128.88 mg/dL;P=0.005) in participants who received at least 4 weeks of a curcumin intervention (turmeric extract, curcuminoids, curcumin); however, heterogeneity was high. Compared with nondiabetic participants, dysglycemic patients (ie, prediabetic patients or those with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome) experienced a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose (WMD, \u221213.86 mg/dL;P<0.001); again, heterogeneity was high, and significance was lost when heterogeneity was reduced. When stratified by intervention, both curcumin (70 mg/day to 4 g/day) and curcuminoids (294 mg/day to 1.5 g/day) produced significant benefit in fasting blood glucose, while turmeric extract (2.4 to 3 g/day) did not; significant benefit was retained only with curcuminoids with reduction of heterogeneity. HbA1cand not insulin resistance (per Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance) was significantly reduced overall (\u22120.54%;P=0.049) and with curcumin (\u22121.07%;P<0.01) in dysglycemic patients; this result did not change with reversal of heterogeneity via study exclusion.

            "Despite studies showing efficacy of curcumin in ulcerative colitis patients, it is important to note that high remission rates among patients receiving placebo (22% to 45%), as well as differences in purity and concentration of active curcumin product formulations (ranging from 5% to 95%), present potential confounders to the interpretation and clinical application of study results.(Bernstein 2015,Salomon 2016) A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial in 89 patients with ulcerative colitis given curcumin (1 g twice daily in combination with standard mesalamine or sulfasalazine therapy) for maintenance of remission showed statistically nonsignificant differences in relapse rates compared with placebo. However, secondary outcomes at 6 months, as measured by clinical activity and endoscopic activity indices, were improved with the addition of curcumin (mean difference [MD] from placebo, \u22121.2 and \u22120.8, respectively). This was the only trial that met inclusion criteria for a Cochrane systematic review (published in 2012) assessing the safety and efficacy of curcumin for maintenance of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.(Hanai 2006,Kumar 2012) Subsequently, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 50 patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis resistant to high-dose mesalamine (at least 4 g/day) investigated the efficacy of add-on curcumin (95% pure, 1.5 g twice daily) for induction of remission. After 1 month, clinical remission was significantly higher in the treatment group for both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses (53.8% vs 0% [P=0.01] and 56% vs 0% [P<0.01], respectively). Similarly, in the subgroup of patients who underwent endoscopy (n=38), significantly higher rates of endoscopic remission (36.3% vs 0%;P=0.043), endoscopic improvement (45.4% vs 0%;P<0.01), endoscopic subscores (mean change, \u22120.55 vs +0.15;P=0.04), clinical remission (50% vs 0%;P=0.02), and clinical improvement (72.7% vs 18.7%;P=0.002) were observed compared with placebo. No difference in rate of adverse reactions was observed between groups. Significance was retained in patients without background immunomodulator therapy.(Lang 2015,Lang 2016) In a subsequent 2018 systematic review of 3 clinical trials of patients with ulcerative colitis (N=194), pooled data for the effect of oral adjuvant curcumin therapy on remission revealed equivocal results. Heterogeneity was moderate and high for the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, respectively.(Grammatikopoulou 2018) In contrast, a systematic review and a meta-analysis published in 2020 (7 studies, N=380) reported significant improvement in clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic response/remission of ulcerative colitis with adjuvant curcumin compared to controls (P=0.002,P=0.001,P=0.01, respectively).(Chandan 2020) One clinical review (3 studies, N=184) included 2 studies in which oral curcumin was used for remission induction in patients with ulcerative colitis, and 1 study in which a curcumin enema was used to maintain remission.

A 2016 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigated adjunctive use of curcumin in 68 Iranian adults with gastric pain, dyspepsia symptoms, and confirmed gastric or duodenal ulcers in the presence of Helicobacter pylori. In addition to standard H. pylori triple therapy, patients received curcumin 500 mg plus piperine 5 mg daily. Results showed an equal rate of infection eradication (73.3%) in both groups; significant improvement in all dyspepsia symptoms, except vomiting, and improvement in total severity scores (P<0.001) were also observed in both groups. However, adjunctive use of curcumin led to significantly greater improvements in belching (P=0.028), upper abdominal dull ache (P=0.002), stomach pain before meals (P=0.004), and total dyspeptic severity scores (P<0.001). More patients in the curcumin group reached a nondyspeptic total score by the end of the study than in the placebo group (27.6% vs 6.7%, respectively;P<0.001), and significantly more patients receiving curcumin had resolution of dyspepsia (P=0.042).

Treatments were administered in divided doses 3 times daily 30 to 60 minutes after each meal of the day and all patients received lifestyle modification education. A significant baseline difference in BMI among groups (curcumin group being overweight and simethicone group normal weight) was noted. Rates of recurrence (unadjusted) 2 weeks after treatment discontinuation were highest in the C. longa groups (1,500 mg, 45.5%; 750 mg 42.9%) and were much lower with simethicone (13.6%;P=0.047); no difference was observed in the duration of recurrence among groups. Adverse events were reported in 11.9% of patients on C. longa (5 of 22 in 750 mg group; 1 of 22 in 1,500 mg group) with fever, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and headache being the most common.

            "Clinical trials have generally reported few adverse reactions with turmeric or curcumin ingestion, even at the high dosages used in cancer trials.(Dhillon 2008,Sharma 2004) GI-related symptoms have been reported.(Amin 2015,Joshi 2003,Pari 2008,Sharma 2004) Yellow stools are often reported.(Gopi 2017,J\u00e4ger 2014,Purpura 2018,Schiborr 2014) Allergic contact dermatitis has been reported. One patient with a 3-month history of daily turmeric tea intake experienced a rash a few days after rubbing a fresh turmeric massage oil on her skin(Lopez-Villafuerte 2016), while 2 other patients had a similar reaction after using curcumin-containing chlorhexidine solutions(Chlorhexidine 2004); patch tests were positive for curcumin in all 3 cases. A case of an anaphylactoid-like response(Adamski 2010) and a case of anaphylaxis after turmeric ingestion(Robinson 2003) have been documented. Over a 3-day period, the patient experiencing anaphylaxis experienced recurrent urticaria and angioedema that was unresponsive to treatment with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids. Allergy testing for turmeric was positive.(Robinson 2003) A review identified 3 studies (N=121) and 10 case reports confirming allergenic potential of curcumin via patch and skin prick testing.(Chaudhari 2015) A 2017 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Safety Alert documented 2 acute serious hypersensitivity cases resulting from IV injection of a curcumin emulsion compounded with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 40 castor oil; the latter is an ungraded product that is not suitable for human consumption and is known to cause hypersensitivity reactions. Both patients had a positive history of allergies; 1 case was fatal. The safety profile of curcumin administered by the IV route has not been established. Following analysis of the curcumin emulsion by the FDA, the manufacturer recalled all unexpired products containing the ungraded PEG 40 castor oil.(FDA 2017)",

After 1 month of taking 40 to 60 pills daily, he presented with a 2-hour history of sudden dizziness, chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and nausea. His electrocardiogram showed a second-degree Mobitz type 1 atrioventricular block that resolved with discontinuation of turmeric and recurred upon re-challenge.(Lee 2011)",
            "Turmeric contains relatively high concentrations of oxalate, and increased levels of urinary oxalate excretion have been demonstrated.(Tang 2008) Although the risk of kidney stone formation may be increased in susceptible individuals, reports of kidney adverse effects are lacking. The addition of curcumin to the diets of mice induced iron deficiency anemia, including a decline in serum iron, decreased hematocrit, decreased transferrin saturation, and appearance of hypochromic red blood cells. Curcumin also decreased iron levels in the bone marrow and spleen.(Jiao 2009) A case of iron deficiency anemia likely caused by supplementation with high-dose turmeric (3,228 mg/day) has been reported in a 66-year-old male physician. Causality was ultimately based on improvement in iron, ferritin, and hemoglobin levels subsequent to stopping the turmeric supplement.(Smith 2019)",

Product contamination or adulteration could not be ruled out in at least 1 of the cases.(Chand 2020,Lukefahr 2018,Suhail 2020) Data collected between 2004 and 2013 from 8 US centers in the Drug-induced Liver Injury Network revealed that 15.5% (130) of hepatotoxicity cases were caused by herbals and dietary supplements, whereas 85% (709) of cases were related to prescription medications. Of the 130 cases of liver injury related to supplements, 65% were from non-bodybuilding supplements and occurred most often in Hispanics/Latinos compared with non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. Liver transplant was also more frequent with toxicity from non-bodybuilding supplements (13%) than with conventional medications (3%) (P<0.001). Overall, the proportion of severe liver injury cases was significantly higher for supplements than for conventional medications (P=0.02). Of the 217 supplement products implicated in liver injury, 175 had identifiable ingredients, of which turmeric was among the 32 (18%) single-ingredient products. (Lain\u00e9 2017,Navarro 2014) Additional cases of turmeric-induced acute hepatitis continue to be reported with causality associated with turmeric assessed to be \u201chighly probable\" and \u201cprobable.\"(Luber 2019,Lombardi 2021)",

Traditionally, echinacea has been used to prevent and treat the common cold; however, quality clinical trial data are lacking. Anxiolytic and immunomodulatory effects have been investigated. Specific recommendations for use for any indication are unreliable due to variations in composition of commercial echinacea products and inconsistent clinical trial results.",

During the 1800s, claims of curative properties of the plant ranged from blood purification to treatment of dizziness and rattlesnake bites. During the early 20th century, extracts of echinacea were used as anti-infectives; however, use of these products fell out of favor after the discovery of modern antibiotics.

The study did not include a placebo group; participants were randomized to receive 1 or 2 capsules (each capsule containing 20 mg of extract) daily for 1 week. Only the higher dose resulted in a reduction in anxiety scores during treatment and for 2 weeks after.(Haller 2013) The observed effect may be due to lipophilic alkylamide constituents interacting with cannabinoid receptors.(Sarris 2013) A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study enrolled 108 physically healthy adults 18 to 65 years of age with symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety to explore the effects of E. anugustifolia standardized extract on anxiety, positive and negative affect symptoms, insomnia, and quality of life (QOL). Recruitment occurred between May and June 2020 in Australia, and the extract was administered at a low (40 mg/day) and high (80 mg/day) dose. At week 6, all groups demonstrated significant improvement in anxiety total scores (by 31% to 35%) as well as psychological and somatic sub-scale scores from baseline with no differences observed between groups. Negative affect scores were also significantly improved in all groups; however, significant increases in positive affect scores were only seen in the echinacea groups compared to baseline (P\u22640.001 each dose). Compared to placebo, positive and negative affect changes were significant in the echinacea low- and high-dose groups (P=0.001 andP=0.041, respectively). In the QOL scores, both echinacea groups demonstrated better emotional well-being than placebo (P=0.043 and 0.046, respectively, for the low and high dose). Additionally, the high-dose group was found to have better social functioning (P=0.043) and general health (P=0.049) scores than placebo.
